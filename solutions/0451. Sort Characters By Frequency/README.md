# solutions\0451. Sort Characters By Frequency

Difficulty: `medium`

Topics: `Hash Table`, `String`, `Sorting`, `Heap (Priority Queue)`, `Bucket Sort`, `Counting`

## Q

Given a string `s`, sort it in **decreasing order** based on the **frequency** of the characters. The **frequency** of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return _the sorted string_. If there are multiple answers, return _any of them_.

<br>

Example 1:

```
Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc"
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: s = "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"
Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```

Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10`<sup>`5`</sup>
- `s` consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.

## S

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:
        cnt = Counter(s)
        return ''.join(c * v for c, v in sorted(cnt.items(), key=lambda x: -x[1]))
```
