Topics: `Math`, `Dynamic Programming`, `Breadth-First Search`

## Q

Given an integer `n`, return _the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to `n`_.

A **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, `1`, `4`, `9`, and `16` are perfect squares while `3` and `11` are not.

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.
```

Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 10`<sup>`4`</sup>

## S

```python
class Solution:
    def numSquares(self, n: int) -> int:
        m = int(sqrt(n))
        f = [[inf] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        f[0][0] = 0
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(n + 1):
                f[i][j] = f[i - 1][j]
                if j >= i * i:
                    f[i][j] = min(f[i][j], f[i][j - i * i] + 1)
        return f[m][n]
```
