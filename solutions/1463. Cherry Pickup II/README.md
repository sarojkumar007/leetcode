# solutions\1463. Cherry Pickup II

Difficulty: `hard`

Topics: `Array`, `Dynamic Programming`, `Matrix`

## Q

You are given a `rows x cols` matrix `grid` representing a field of cherries where `grid[i][j]` represents the number of cherries that you can collect from the `(i, j)` cell.

You have two robots that can collect cherries for you:

- **Robot #1** is located at the **top-left corner** `(0, 0)`, and
- **Robot #2** is located at the **top-right corner** `(0, cols - 1)`.

Return _the maximum number of cherries collection using both robots by following the rules below_:

- From a cell `(i, j)`, robots can move to cell `(i + 1, j - 1)`, `(i + 1, j)`, or `(i + 1, j + 1)`.

- When any robot passes through a cell, It picks up all cherries, and the cell becomes an empty cell.

- When both robots stay in the same cell, only one takes the cherries.

- Both robots cannot move outside of the grid at any moment.

- Both robots should reach the bottom row in `grid`.

Example 1:

![Ex1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/29/sample_1_1802.png)

```
Input: grid = [[3,1,1],[2,5,1],[1,5,5],[2,1,1]]
Output: 24
Explanation: Path of robot #1 and #2 are described in color green and blue respectively.
Cherries taken by Robot #1, (3 + 2 + 5 + 2) = 12.
Cherries taken by Robot #2, (1 + 5 + 5 + 1) = 12.
Total of cherries: 12 + 12 = 24.
```

Example 2:

![Ex2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/23/sample_2_1802.png)

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0,0,0,1],[2,0,0,0,0,3,0],[2,0,9,0,0,0,0],[0,3,0,5,4,0,0],[1,0,2,3,0,0,6]]
Output: 28
Explanation: Path of robot #1 and #2 are described in color green and blue respectively.
Cherries taken by Robot #1, (1 + 9 + 5 + 2) = 17.
Cherries taken by Robot #2, (1 + 3 + 4 + 3) = 11.
Total of cherries: 17 + 11 = 28.
```

Constraints:

- `rows == grid.length`
- `cols == grid[i].length`
- `2 <= rows, cols <= 70`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`

```python
class Solution:
    def cherryPickup(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        f = [[[-1] * n for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
        f[0][0][n - 1] = grid[0][0] + grid[0][n - 1]
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j1 in range(n):
                for j2 in range(n):
                    x = grid[i][j1] + (0 if j1 == j2 else grid[i][j2])
                    for y1 in range(j1 - 1, j1 + 2):
                        for y2 in range(j2 - 1, j2 + 2):
                            if 0 <= y1 < n and 0 <= y2 < n and f[i - 1][y1][y2] != -1:
                                f[i][j1][j2] = max(f[i][j1][j2], f[i - 1][y1][y2] + x)
        return max(f[-1][j1][j2] for j1, j2 in product(range(n), range(n)))
