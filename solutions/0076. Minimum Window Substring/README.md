# solutions\0076. Minimum Window Substring

Difficulty: `hard`

Topics: `Hash Table`, `String`, `Sliding Window`

## Q

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return _the **minimum window**
<span title="A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string."><em>substring</em></span> of `s` such that every character in `t` (**including duplicates**) is included in the window_. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

Example 1:

```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

Constraints:

- `m == s.length`
- `n == t.length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10`<sup>`5`</sup>
- `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        if t == "":
            return ""

        countT, window = {}, {}
        for c in t:
            countT[c] = 1 + countT.get(c, 0)

        have, need = 0, len(countT)
        res, resLen = [-1, -1], float("inf")
        l = 0
        for r in range(len(s)):
            c = s[r]
            window[c] = 1 + window.get(c, 0)

            if c in countT and window[c] == countT[c]:
                have += 1

            while have == need:
                # update our result
                if (r - l + 1) < resLen:
                    res = [l, r]
                    resLen = r - l + 1
                # pop from the left of our window
                window[s[l]] -= 1
                if s[l] in countT and window[s[l]] < countT[s[l]]:
                    have -= 1
                l += 1
        l, r = res
        return s[l : r + 1] if resLen != float("inf") else ""
```
